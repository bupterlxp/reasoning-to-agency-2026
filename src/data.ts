      'If your work helps explain or improve how foundation models reason, learn, act, or adapt, we would like to hear from you. We welcome empirical and theoretical work, systems, datasets, benchmarks, position papers, and carefully analyzed negative results. The topic list is illustrative, not exhaustive; connections across research areas are especially welcome.',

    question: 'What are the paper format and review requirements?',
    answer:
      'Please use the official ACL/ARR template in review mode and submit an anonymized PDF. Review will be double-blind: author identities must not appear in the paper or supplementary materials. Final page limits and the submission portal will be announced here. Please follow the ACL guidance for citations and anonymized artifacts.',

    question: 'Can I submit a paper already reviewed by ARR?',

      'An ACL Rolling Review (ARR) commitment route is under consideration. Eligibility, a dedicated commitment link, and any separate deadline will be published if this route is offered. Until then, September 30, 2026 is the announced paper submission deadline; no ARR extension is confirmed.',

      'The publication policy, including whether proceedings will appear in the ACL Anthology, is to be confirmed. Archival status and policies affecting submission of the same work to other venues will be stated in the final guidelines. The October 15 proceedings deadline is for organizers if archival proceedings are produced; it is not an additional author deadline.',
